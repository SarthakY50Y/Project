<h1><center><b><i><u>Big Bang</u></i></b></center></h1>
<p>
The Big Bang Theory is a widely accepted explanation for the existence of our universe .<br>It states that the universe began as a singularity from a hot dense state and rapidly expanded over nearly 13.8 billions years ago to the state that we are in present at, and continues to expand.<br> This model was proposed by Russian Mathematician Alexander Friedman And Belgian Astronomer Georges Lemarite during 1920s.<br>

<h2>Begining of Time and the dawn of light</h2>
<p>
According to the theory the universe expanded from a highly compresed state. The cosmos containedva multitude of fundamental particles as electrons, protons, neutrons etc. The free electrons make light impossible to pass through, thus rendering our universe in darkness. There was a huge amount of dark energy, a mesteripous force that is thought to be the driving force behind our universe.

<h2>Falling Temperature and big afterglow</h2>
<p>
As the univerese expanded, it also began to cool down rapidly. The temprature dropped drasticallynfrom an extermely hot 5.5 billion degrees. This caused the elementary particles to combine. Specifically, the protons decayed and the free electrons combined with nuclei. A million year later, this light started passing through the universe. This primary light, or the "afterglow", is known as the Cosmic Microwawe Background Radiation (CMBR).
