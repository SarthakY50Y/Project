<h1><center><b><i><u>Wormholes</u></i></b></center></h1>
<p>
A wormhole is a passage through the space-time continuum that could create a quicker route for long journeys across the universe. This is true only in theory. The existence of wormholes is predicted on the basis of the theory of general relativity. They could be dangerous and in case of a sudden collapse, extreme radiation and unsafe contact with exotic matter could occur.

<h2>Wormholes and the theory of general relativity</h2>

<p>
Lorentzian wormholes, also known as Schwarzschild wormholes or Einstein–Rosen bridges, connect the spacetime of Einstein’s field equations through merging nodes of black and white holes. Physicists Albert Einstein and Nathan Rosen used the theory of general relativity in 1935 to suggest that ‘bridges’ may connect two different points in space and time, creating a shortcut, reducing the time, energy and distance, but only in theory.
</p>
<h2>What do wormholes look like?</h2>
<p>
They have two possibly spherical mouths connected by a throat, which could be straight or curved. Astrophysicist Stephen Hawking suggested that wormholes may exist in quantum foam — the tiny environment in the universe where space and time are continuously fluctuating and small wormholes could connect different places and time.
</p>
<h2>Problems of wormholes.</h2>
<p>
Size is one issue with wormholes. It is believed that wormholes exist on a microscopic level, which are about 10⁻³⁵ cm wide. However, there is a possibility that some may have stretched to larger sizes.
</p>
<h2>Time Travel</h2>
<p>
Theoretically, wormholes connecting two separate regions within the universe could also connect different points in time. It has been suggested that if one end of a wormhole were accelerated to near the speed of light and then brought back to its original position, time dilation would cause a time difference between the two ends.
</p>
<h2>A tunnel in space</h2>
<p>
One of the most common visual representations of a wormhole is a tunnel-like structure joining two separate points in space. They could also create shortcuts between different parts of the universe, allowing travel that would otherwise take millions of years.
</p>
<h2>Too small for travel</h2>
<p>
Wormholes are believed to be extremely small. Most theories suggest they exist at a quantum level, making them far too small for humans or spacecraft to travel through.
</p>
<h2>Speedy travel</h2>
<p>
Wormholes, if they exist, could allow faster-than-light travel by providing a shortcut through space-time. However, travelling through a wormhole would be extremely dangerous and remains purely theoretical.
